      <h2 style="margin-top: 220px;">Information Architecture </h2>
      <p>Aldwin D. Vergara | October 17, 2020<p>
      <h3>
        For every paper, activity, and project that we do, the basic step that we should always
        take is to first plan out the idea and its structure, organization, and design. Same thing as to
        how websites are made, one should first understand and plan out what would the site look and
        how the sets of information are incorporated along the structure of the website. This
        organization and structuration of information with objects and design is what we call the
        Information Architecture — which is a key factor of a website development.
        <br><br><br>

        Among the people who plan out what they’re websites would look like and plan how
        the information in a site would be placed and work together, I am 100% not one of them. To
        be honest, as I’ve mentioned in my past reflection papers, I just put everything that comes up
        in my mind to my website that I think that is “cool” or “amazing”. Whenever I see something
        interesting or a feature from other sites that looked amazing such as movements of boxes as I
        scroll through the page, hover effects, image carousels, and moving or sticky menus, I would
        then immediately research how to implement them and work my way through the day to add
        them on my site. At the end of the day my site would look kind of amazing, but when viewed
        to see the bigger picture, it looks like a mind dump. But of course, I’m just a rookie for these
        things. And just like in games, in order for me and my skills to level up, I need XP (experience
        points) — and this is where my friend information architecture (IA) comes in. Upon the
        discussion, information architecture helps in organization of schemes or contents that allows
        access of information in various ways. IA is the structural design of shared information
        environments and science of organizing the contents of our websites. The lesson last time is
        very helpful for us since we are just starting to develop our own personal websites. From the
        discussion, we could easily pick general ideas and structures that we wanted to incorporate on
        the design and organization of our sites. The topic was interesting because I do like developing
        a website. This added knowledge would benefit me and my future plans for it gives me a wider
        understanding of website design. I’ve learned that there are a lot of ways to organize the
        schemes of our content. I find it interesting and amazing to see through the differences
        because I am also used and exposed to various websites that have different information
        architecture. For example, Twitter is a good example of a site with respect to date and
        Wikipedia is indeed a topic-centered site. For years of website development, the websites that
        I created always falls under ‘Organic’ in which there’s no organization of scheme and where I 
        just put entry point pages. I’m not surprised with this fact, but I will make use of the knowledge
        I gain from IA to further improve on my future projects and provide a proper design and
        organization scheme. On the other hand, I am very much familiar and say knowledgeable on
        working my way through the types of navigation. I usually include navbars for most of my sites
        as a global navigation for the major parts of my site. I was able to work with local navigation
        such as sticky menus and buttons that let users move around the current section. And I also
        use contextual navigation and see also navigation for links for further information.
        <br><br><br>
        Overall, information architecture is highly concerned on the usability of the website and
        the experience of a user navigating the site. Websites are created for the users to use so we
        must organize the contents in a way lets the user easily navigate and understand the content.
        I am looking forward to organizing and coding my personal portfolio again and apply the
        proper information architecture. In this way, my site would have a professional look and
        structure and it will offer a more user-friendly web application.
