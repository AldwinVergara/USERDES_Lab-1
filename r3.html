      <h2>Need Finding <br> (Design Problem)</h2>
      <p>Aldwin D. Vergara | October 4, 2020<p>
      <h3>
        Our group project is both exciting and scary at the same time. It is exciting because we were
        able to try out and learn new things, especially for the experience mapping and persona part. I have
        never realized that I will have to encounter such things and I didn’t know what’s the relation of it to my
        course and subject. But, after everything, it is kind of exciting to venture to topics and practices that is
        unfamiliar with me and I now know, that those parts are crucial when I’m already in the industry. On
        the other hand, the group project is scary. Because first of all, I was one of the leaders. I did not expect
        that my surname would be on the trello card with groups and group leaders. I’m supposed to lead a
        group that has to come up with fresh ideas and plans for all the group works that needed to be done.
        I’m supposed to support my teammates and be active about everything. I must be a great leader so
        that my groupmates and I could pass the requirements. And we still don’t know why we are chosen
        (hehehe). But it was fun! I don’t regret a single thing. Just like what the popular phrase say, “with great
        power comes great responsibility.” All the activities are actually challenging. I just have this characteristic
        in me that everything should be perfect and right, so I stress myself too much about the group project.
        But all in all, the output turned out to be fine, and I had a good time with the project, and especially
        with my groupmates.
        <br><br><br>

        <b style="font-size: 25px;">Week 1: Brainstorming <br></b>
        The good thing about our group is that we utilized Microsoft Teams for group discussions.
        From the very beginning, we would meet in Teams and discuss and do what is needed to be done. I
        was actually not that shy to handle my group in the first place because my groupmates, Christian Paul
        Duria and Sim Paul Palacio are friends of mine, so we had it easy to communicate and brainstorm. The
        most difficult part of the group project for me is the very first part of the group project: the problem
        statement. The problem statement is the root of everything. It is where everything follows. We did not
        have difficulty upon choosing a problem to focus to, but we had difficulty refining our problem to a
        specific problem statement. We had a lot of revisions to it to the point that we had to ask our professor
        and help us with it. After choosing one problem statement, we then proceed on making personas and
        experience map and we set deadlines to finish everything in time. At the end of the week, we were able
        to finish everything and we really had a great presentation. We had a final discussion to finalize
        everything and had a run through and decided to make up a script so our presentation would run
        smooth and would look professional.
        <br><br><br>

        <b style="font-size: 25px;">Week 2: Revisions and Presentation Updates <br></b>
        The 2nd week had been our chill week. We updated our previous presentation from the feedback
        we got from our professor and then proceeded to do the next activity, storyboards. We enjoyed this
        part of the progress for we had received great feedback from our last presentation. It pushed us to 
        strive and work hard for the next activity and presentation. We decided to split our storyboards and
        make one story for each groupmate. In this way, everyone participated and had experience to create a
        storyboard. The fun part of the week is when the day of our deadline for the storyboards came. I was
        ashamed of my storyboard work. As a leader, I should’ve set an example on how to do the activity, but
        it turned out now that good-looking. Christian Duria overdo his! The team had a good laugh discussing
        the storyboards we made, and we really had fun making and preparing for the next presentation. We
        were joking that Paul should’ve made all of our storyboards if he told us that he would be great at it in
        the first place. The presentation day came but unfortunately, it was the time when there’s a slow internet
        connection due to the maintenance. We didn’t have a class discussion that week to present our ideas,
        but we presented to other groups. Even though that presentation day turned out to beunexpected, it
        still was a productive week for the feedbacks from the other group helped us prepare and refine our
        presentation for the midterms week.  <br><br><br>
        
        <b style="font-size: 25px;">Week 3: Midterms Week<br></b>
        The midterms week had come. It was the week where everyone is rushing to finish everything and meet
        deadlines. We only had one discussion to prepare because we had other things to do. We again, revised
        our presentation and what made our discussion long is that we had to create a prototype. I was sharing
        my screen and I’m the one who’s making our low fidelity prototype on MS Paint. It was a productive
        meeting because everyone collaborated on the prototype. Each member shared ideas and we had fun
        making it for we joke around during the meeting. We again created a script for our presentation, and
        we finalized everything. The day of our presentation came, and I was very nervous to present. I’m
        comfortable and okay with my groupmates and with the class, but the fact that it is the midterm
        presentation, it made me worried about everything. So, I think that it affected the way how I presented.
        But, at the end of the day, we were able to present well. The presentation didn’t meet my expectations,
        but I’m still very thankful for my team and their hard work. I wouldn’t made it this far without them, and
        I appreciate all their efforts. <br><br><br>

        The group project was a thrilling journey, and I’m so happy for our progress. After all, I think
        that I did a good job leading my team and I’ll be more than happy to lead them again for the finals. I
        will use this experience to even motivate us more and we will double our efforts on the next half of our
        journey. I may have been stressed and anxious about our group project as a leader, but it was also an
        exciting and fun experience. I’m very much looking forward for the next activities for I know that it will
        be challenging than ever. The real game starts now. It will be scary, but I know that everything is going
        to be worth it.
