      <h2>My First Few Weeks of USERDES</h2>
      <h3>USERDES class never failed to meet my expectations. For the first few sessions, it was
        really educating and at the same time fun and interactive. I have learned a lot of
        topics/discussion about the basics of user design and I’m amazed that I was able to put too
        much effort into applying what I’ve learned to the weekly tasks. Although I have a background
        idea/skill with regard to the subject matters, the first weeks still gave me new insights about
        design, website development, personas, and prototype.<br><br>

        The sessions affected my ideas by simply telling me that before I jump to creating or
        designing a website, I must first go through the initial process of understanding why would I
        create a website; what will be the content; how will the site look by lay out; and who will be the
        target audience or users of my website. Before, back in our senior high school days, I just put
        whatever content I find to my website. When I thought about a topic or the main idea for a
        site, I would just search for anything I would l like to put and implement it by coding. So, in the
        end, my site would just look like a compilation of design, animation, and other cool stuff that
        make up a website (in which not so “cool” to look at when compiled together). But after learning
        about personas and prototype, it gave me a fresh perspective on how I will create a site. By
        creating a persona, I was able to determine my potential site visitors/users and I was able to
        incorporate with them the contents and look of how my future site will be. In this way, I will be
        able to satisfy both of my expectations and plans for my site, and the users who will be looking
        and navigating through my site. I see that creating personas is essential because it helps me
        think to myself how I’m going to showcase my personal my website and receive great feedback
        or results. Another thing that helped me changed how I think is about considering prototypes
        as important as implementing and coding the actual site. Like what I’ve said, I just put anything
        I thought and search of to my site without considering the layout and how will the site look like
        when everything is put together. But now that I’m introduced to prototypes, I can now manage
        and design properly my website to plan everything smoothly, and to be able to produce a
        much better-looking and user-friendly site. Prototypes can be backbones of a solid site, and
        with their correlation with one another, I can easily point out the things I wanted to include and
        then manage everything to look as if everything is created by a professional website developer.
        <br><br>

        On a side note, the USERDES class also changed how I think about undergoing online
        classes. When we first took our course packs last term, I became a non- fan of online classes. I
        think that it was much harder to learn since being at home exposes us to more distraction than
        in a traditional classroom setting. So, when I heard that we’re going to push through this term
        with the course packs, I was not looking forward to it because we are left with our tasks to do
        alone without guidance and without someone to look after us. But after taking this class, it gave
        me a new hope. I really like the way how our professor approach our class. She’s very energetic,
        and she really tries to connect with us regardless of the unfortunate situation we’re having. I
        can see that she is really passionate to teach and that she really wanted her students to learn
        a lot about the course. And somehow, I really felt the connection between the teacher and the
        students and it helped me engage more into learning despite having through it in an online
        class. The past sessions also included games for us to enjoy while still learning (e.g. Kahoot!
        And the Inyerface site). In this way, we are able to grasp the idea/context of the topic while
        having fun and taking out the word “boring” in an online class. With our professor’s type of
        teaching style, I’m looking forward for more classes and I’m ready to learn more about user
        design.
        <br><br>

        Overall, the first few weeks of USERDESS class improved my skills and my
        understanding. Like what they say, “learning never stops”, and this class makes sure that that
        line is done accordingly. I have realized during this process that I can be better on developing
        a website. I realize that there are really plenty of room for improvements and I can see that I’m
        making most of myself to maximize these rooms. I realize that I should also maximize this
        opportunity to improve myself since I’m very fortunate that I can still have my classes while the
        rest of our people struggles. I would take this chance to hone my skills and will never waste a
        single second for my betterment. I’m happy with my improvements and I’m striving to learn
        more to challenge myself and be the better IT professional that I will soon be in the future.

    <h2>Reflection #2</h2>
    <h3>My favorite application at the moment is the famous, Facebook application. What I like about
      this application is that you could share, read, watch, stalk, view, and post almost everything. What makes
      it good for me is that the application is the source of my happiness when I see funny posts such as
      memes and watch videos that entertains me. I follow pages that I liked and whenever I’m not doing
      anything, I’m on Facebook; and I just scroll and scroll to my heart’s content. I think I’ve been using
      Facebook for over 8 years now. I remember creating an account when I was in my 6th grade and I just
      post and share anything that I want. I was able to talk to my friends and classmates through this app
      back then, since Messenger is not yet created and developed at that time. The features on Facebook
      really developed for the better over the years. I was able to play online games through the app; watch
      videos, posts pictures, videos, and texts; I could save posts for later use; I use its albums as a backup or
      dump for the photos and videos stored in my phone to free up some space; and you can create and
      support pages that create almost any content such as a school’s dashboard, newscasts, foundations,
      gaming content, and charities. Mainly, what I like about this Facebook application is that I could catch
      up with my friends, family, relatives, and colleagues lives and stories with what they post and share. It’s
      a way for us to really connect with each other still keeping in check what’s happening with our lives. We
      get to share the same experience and able to contribute meaningful to someone else’s lives. This
      application really bridges lives and relationships regardless of distance and time.
