      <h2>My First Few Weeks <br>of USERDES</h2>
      <h3>USERDES class never failed to meet my expectations. For the first few sessions, it was
        really educating and at the same time fun and interactive. I have learned a lot of
        topics/discussion about the basics of user design and I’m amazed that I was able to put too
        much effort into applying what I’ve learned to the weekly tasks. Although I have a background
        idea/skill with regard to the subject matters, the first weeks still gave me new insights about
        design, website development, personas, and prototype.<br><br>

        The sessions affected my ideas by simply telling me that before I jump to creating or
        designing a website, I must first go through the initial process of understanding why would I
        create a website; what will be the content; how will the site look by lay out; and who will be the
        target audience or users of my website. Before, back in our senior high school days, I just put
        whatever content I find to my website. When I thought about a topic or the main idea for a
        site, I would just search for anything I would l like to put and implement it by coding. So, in the
        end, my site would just look like a compilation of design, animation, and other cool stuff that
        make up a website (in which not so “cool” to look at when compiled together). But after learning
        about personas and prototype, it gave me a fresh perspective on how I will create a site. By
        creating a persona, I was able to determine my potential site visitors/users and I was able to
        incorporate with them the contents and look of how my future site will be. In this way, I will be
        able to satisfy both of my expectations and plans for my site, and the users who will be looking
        and navigating through my site. I see that creating personas is essential because it helps me
        think to myself how I’m going to showcase my personal my website and receive great feedback
        or results. Another thing that helped me changed how I think is about considering prototypes
        as important as implementing and coding the actual site. Like what I’ve said, I just put anything
        I thought and search of to my site without considering the layout and how will the site look like
        when everything is put together. But now that I’m introduced to prototypes, I can now manage
        and design properly my website to plan everything smoothly, and to be able to produce a
        much better-looking and user-friendly site. Prototypes can be backbones of a solid site, and
        with their correlation with one another, I can easily point out the things I wanted to include and
        then manage everything to look as if everything is created by a professional website developer.
        <br><br>

        On a side note, the USERDES class also changed how I think about undergoing online
        classes. When we first took our course packs last term, I became a non- fan of online classes. I
        think that it was much harder to learn since being at home exposes us to more distraction than
        in a traditional classroom setting. So, when I heard that we’re going to push through this term
        with the course packs, I was not looking forward to it because we are left with our tasks to do
        alone without guidance and without someone to look after us. But after taking this class, it gave
        me a new hope. I really like the way how our professor approach our class. She’s very energetic,
        and she really tries to connect with us regardless of the unfortunate situation we’re having. I
        can see that she is really passionate to teach and that she really wanted her students to learn
        a lot about the course. And somehow, I really felt the connection between the teacher and the
        students and it helped me engage more into learning despite having through it in an online
        class. The past sessions also included games for us to enjoy while still learning (e.g. Kahoot!
        And the Inyerface site). In this way, we are able to grasp the idea/context of the topic while
        having fun and taking out the word “boring” in an online class. With our professor’s type of
        teaching style, I’m looking forward for more classes and I’m ready to learn more about user
        design.
        <br><br>

        Overall, the first few weeks of USERDESS class improved my skills and my
        understanding. Like what they say, “learning never stops”, and this class makes sure that that
        line is done accordingly. I have realized during this process that I can be better on developing
        a website. I realize that there are really plenty of room for improvements and I can see that I’m
        making most of myself to maximize these rooms. I realize that I should also maximize this
        opportunity to improve myself since I’m very fortunate that I can still have my classes while the
        rest of our people struggles. I would take this chance to hone my skills and will never waste a
        single second for my betterment. I’m happy with my improvements and I’m striving to learn
        more to challenge myself and be the better IT professional that I will soon be in the future.

    <h2>Introduction to Design <br>Thinking Process</h2>
    <h3>I’m not really familiar with the Design Thinking Process. In fact, I did not know that design thinking
       has a process with five stages. The first time that I’ve encountered this concept was one of our Kahoot 
       sessions. I almost had a perfect score during that Kahoot assessment activity (with 1 mistake, sad). But 
       the reason that I got that score even without any background of the concept was I was researching each 
       question. When I observed the first five questions of the assessment, I noticed that the questions revolved
      around this specific process. So, before moving on to the next question, I did a quick reading about the 
      design thinking process and then answered the assessment. 
      <br><br><br>

      We have been used to the situation when our professors requires us to make something for a project. Before, we would
      just think of an idea and then immediately worked on it until we provide the final output of our product. We did not 
      consider the factors that might first affect and help us through the process. We are not knowledgeable that in order 
      to accomplish an output that might be useful and effective, we must have a systematic way of planning and developing 
      it. Now that I’m knowledgeable about the subject matter, I could maximize and utilize it to be able to achieve a better
      output. I will consider this process for most of my works now to have a solid research, background, design, feedback, 
      and output. Actually, at the moment, as a CS student, this process is actually useful. At the moment, we are working 
      on our personal portfolios using in a website, and we are able to undergo a lot of process for an application in 
      process as a group. What are the odds! I see what you did there, miss. This is actually putting what we’ve learned in 
      class into an actual practice. Our team’s project focuses on how we might help students track their home works from 
      their online classes. Through the emphatise stage, my teammates and I were able to understand and feel what our potential
      users might feel with their problems. Although we did not engage to actual people who feels this way, we looked up 
      articles/blogs that do so. The next stage that develops the best possible understanding of the users is to define their 
      problems. This stage was really useful to us for this became the root of our project. It is where our hard work revolves, 
      for this is when we analyzed our synthesis in order to define the main problem that we have identified, which is in our 
      case, the problems of students managing their activities. The ideation process, the third stage of the Design Thinking 
      Process, is the most collaborative part of our group discussion. This is where our Personas and Storyboards kicked in. 
      We generated ideas to form these things, and from it we are able to identify a tech-solution to the problem statement 
      that we have created. The tech-solution of our project would be an app that keeps track of students assignments and 
      activities, notifies them about it, and offers a systematic planning of what activity to do first. The fourth stage of 
      the process would be the Prototype. Well, in the development of our project and the course, this is where we are all 
      at. We created a prototype to provide an early visualization of how our application would look after completion. The 
      next stage of the process that we have to do is to Test the prototype and see if we meet our expectations. This last 
      stage also helps gather feedback to further improve our process. But we just have to wait for now before proceeding to 
      the last stage. We first need to finish this reflection for our midterms. 
      <br><br><br>

      I never knew that the Design Thinking Process approach would be this useful to us   students. And it will be most useful 
      when we are pursuing our future endeavors in the industry. I will apply this approach to the next projects that I would 
      handle, especially when it concerns user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) designs. I wanted to produce a 
      project/output that exceeds my and our potential users expectations. Therefore, I will maximize the use of the Design 
      Thinking Process to every project.

    <h2>Need Finding <br>(Design Problem)</h2>
    <h3>Our group project is both exciting and scary at the same time. It is exciting because we were able to try out and 
      learn new things, especially for the experience mapping and persona part. I have never realized that I will have to encounter 
      such things and I didn’t know what’s the relation of it to my course and subject. But, after everything, it is kind of 
      exciting to venture to topics and practices that is unfamiliar with me and I now know, that those parts are crucial 
      when I’m already in the industry. On the other hand, the group project is scary. Because first of all, I was one of the 
      leaders. I did not expect that my surname would be on the trello card with groups and group leaders. I’m supposed to 
      lead a group that has to come up with fresh ideas and plans for all the group works that needed to be done. I’m supposed 
      to support my teammates and be active about everything. I must be a great leader so that my groupmates and I could pass 
      the requirements. And we still don’t know why we are chosen (hehehe). But it was fun! I don’t regret a single thing. 
      Just like what the popular phrase say, “with great power comes great responsibility.” All the activities are actually 
      challenging. I just have this characteristic in me that everything should be perfect and right, so I stress myself too 
      much about the group project. But all in all, the output turned out to be fine, and I had a good time with the project, 
      and especially with my groupmates.
      <br><br><br>

      <b style="font-style: italic; font-size:30px">Week 1: Brainstorming</b><br>
      The good thing about our group is that we utilized Microsoft Teams for group discussions. From the very beginning, we 
      would meet in Teams and discuss and do what is needed to be done. I was actually not that shy to handle my group in the 
      first place because my groupmates, Christian Paul Duria and Sim Paul Palacio are friends of mine, so we had it easy to 
      communicate and brainstorm. The most difficult part of the group project for me is the very first part of the group project: 
      the problem statement. The problem statement is the root of everything. It is where everything follows. We did not have 
      difficulty upon choosing a problem to focus to, but we had difficulty refining our problem to a specific problem statement. 
      We had a lot of revisions to it to the point that we had to ask our professor and help us with it. After choosing one problem 
      statement, we then proceed on making personas and experience map and we set deadlines to finish everything in time. At the 
      end of the week, we were able to finish everything and we really had a great presentation. We had a final discussion to 
      finalize everything and had a run through and decided to make up a script so our presentation would run smooth and would 
      look professional.
      <br><br><br>

      <b style="font-style: italic; font-size:30px">Week 2: Revisions and Presentation Updates</b><br>
      The 2nd week had been our chill week. We updated our previous presentation from the feedback we got from our professor and 
      then proceeded to do the next activity, storyboards. We enjoyed this part of the progress for we had received great feedback 
      from our last presentation. It pushed us to strive and work hard for the next activity and presentation. We decided to 
      split our storyboards and make one story for each groupmate. In this way, everyone participated and had experience to 
      create a storyboard. The fun part of the week is when the day of our deadline for the storyboards came. I was ashamed 
      of my storyboard work. As a leader, I should’ve set an example on how to do the activity, but it turned out now that good-looking. 
      Christian Duria overdo his! The team had a good laugh discussing the storyboards we made, and we really had fun making and preparing for 
      the next presentation. We were joking that Paul should’ve made all of our storyboards if he told us that he would be great at it 
      in the first place. The presentation day came but unfortunately, it was the time when there’s a slow internet connection due to the 
      maintenance. We didn’t have a class discussion that week to present our ideas, but we presented to other groups. Even 
      though that presentation day turned out to beunexpected, it still was a productive week for the feedbacks from the other 
      group helped us prepare and refine our presentation for the midterms week.
      <br><br><br>

      <b style="font-style: italic; font-size:30px">Week 3: Midterms Week</b><br>
      The midterms week had come. It was the week where everyone is rushing to finish everything and meet deadlines. We only had one 
      discussion to prepare because we had other things to do. We again, revised our presentation and what made our discussion long 
      is that we had to create a prototype. I was sharing my screen and I’m the one who’s making our low fidelity prototype on MS Paint. 
      It was a productive meeting because everyone collaborated on the prototype. Each member shared ideas and we had fun making it for 
      we joke around during the meeting. We again created a script for our presentation, and we finalized everything. The day of our 
      presentation came, and I was very nervous to present. I’m comfortable and okay with my groupmates and with the class, but the fact 
      that it is the midterm presentation, it made me worried about everything. So, I think that it affected the way how I presented. But, 
      at the end of the day, we were able to present well. The presentation didn’t meet my expectations, but I’m still very thankful for my 
      team and their hard work. I wouldn’t made it this far without them, and I appreciate all their efforts. 
      <br><br><br>

      The group project was a thrilling journey, and I’m so happy for our progress. After all, I think that I did a good job leading my team and 
      I’ll be more than happy to lead them again for the finals. I will use this experience to even motivate us more and we will double our efforts 
      on the next half of our journey. I may have been stressed and anxious about our group project as a leader, but it was also an exciting and fun 
      experience. I’m very much looking forward for the next activities for I know that it will be challenging than ever. The real game starts now. It 
      will be scary, but I know that everything is going to be worth it.
