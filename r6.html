      <h2 style="margin-top: 220px; margin-left: 260px;">Color Theory and Typography </h2>
      <p>Aldwin D. Vergara | November 15, 2020<p>
      <h3>
        This day was the time when we play four games concerning color theory and
        typography as an alternative for our synchronous session. I really enjoyed that time because
        even if we didn’t have a class, it was still productive. We get to expose ourselves to different
        kinds of games that will test our skills in identifying the current color for a certain logo; the
        proper spacing of each character in a word; font sizes, spacing, and padding; and our
        knowledge of font interfaces.
        <br><br><br>

        <b style="font-size:25px">Game 1: Kern Type, the kerning game <br></b>
        This game allows the players to arrange the characters of each word/font to its proper
        place in respect to its spacing. I liked this game because it’s simple, and most of it I got it almost
        perfectly. It was fun to try because I am dead serious playing this game — I almost used my
        ruler to properly measure and assign the spaces in between of the characters. I lost my focus
        on the mid-part of game because that’s the hardest parts. Most of that part involves characters
        that have a thick typography, so it’s really hard to distinguish the spaces. I enjoyed playing the
        game and I got a score of 94 out of 100 for the whole game.  <br><br><br>

        <b style="font-size:25px">Game 2: Brandseen – How well do you recognize these brands?  <br></b>
        This is my favorite game of all because it involves colors and visual design. I loved this
        game because it really caught my attention. I was really challenged to perfectly match the right
        color of the logos of the company we usually knew. At first, I try my best to match the colors.
        If I’m not really sure about the color of the logo, I google it and I match it with accuracy. It was
        really hard to find the right color because we were used to type in the hex colors of things. But
        since the palette only involves dragging your way though to your chosen color, it was really
        challenging — mostly for the dropbox and apple logo because I think there was a bug where
        the colors are gradually faded. However, I still managed to match it correctly and earned a
        score of 95%.<br><br><br>

        
        <b style="font-size:25px">Game 3: Better Web Type <br></b>
        This game frustrated me with my answers and scores. Although I did enjoy playing the
        game, but what I didn’t enjoy is when I got low scores even after I tried my best to answer it to
        the best I could. Well… it was still educational because even if I had troubles answering
        everything, I still learned something new. And this game taught me that no matter how I think
        I see things correctly; I should still look again and double check everything. I scored 82/100 —
        it’s not that high but at least I still managed to do it with my best effort. <br><br><br>

        <b style="font-size:25px">Game 4: Type War<br></b>
        This one’s a little bit different than the rest. This game just makes us choose between
        two fonts to correctly identify the typography or typeface of the letter. Although it still tests our
        skills and knowledge about the different typefaces, I did enjoy playing the game. In fact, the
        game doesn’t have an end. It just goes on and on until I suddenly got bored with it. I managed
        to score a high score in the game and ended with level 7. It was not that easy to reach that
        level but I’m glad that I stayed playing the game for minutes because I had nothing else better
        to do. I got a 12 streak of correct answers and I was really educated to recognize and be familiar
        with the typefaces present in almost everywhere. <br><br><br>

        Overall, the games helped me, and it was really educational. I’m really glad that people
        come up with these things to gamify something educational for students and people to engage
        into. In this way, it removes the boring typical learning setting and pokes interest within the
        players. I am very thankful to experience these games and I will use what I learned from these
        in my next projects to come.
