      <h2>Introduction to <br> Design Thinking Process</h2>
      <p>Aldwin D. Vergara | October 2, 2020<p>
      <h3>
        I’m not really familiar with the Design Thinking Process. In fact, I did not know that
        design thinking has a process with five stages. The first time that I’ve encountered this concept
        was one of our Kahoot sessions. I almost had a perfect score during that Kahoot assessment
        activity (with 1 mistake, sad). But the reason that I got that score even without any background
        of the concept was I was researching each question. When I observed the first five questions
        of the assessment, I noticed that the questions revolved around this specific process. So, before
        moving on to the next question, I did a quick reading about the design thinking process and
        then answered the assessment.<br><br><br>

        We have been used to the situation when our professors requires us to make something
        for a project. Before, we would just think of an idea and then immediately worked on it until
        we provide the final output of our product. We did not consider the factors that might first
        affect and help us through the process. We are not knowledgeable that in order to accomplish
        an output that might be useful and effective, we must have a systematic way of planning and
        developing it. Now that I’m knowledgeable about the subject matter, I could maximize and
        utilize it to be able to achieve a better output. I will consider this process for most of my works
        now to have a solid research, background, design, feedback, and output. Actually, at the
        moment, as a CS student, this process is actually useful. At the moment, we are working on
        our personal portfolios using in a website, and we are able to undergo a lot of process for an
        application in process as a group. What are the odds! I see what you did there, miss. This is
        actually putting what we’ve learned in class into an actual practice. Our team’s project focuses
        on how we might help students track their home works from their online classes. Through the
        emphatise stage, my teammates and I were able to understand and feel what our potential
        users might feel with their problems. Although we did not engage to actual people who feels
        this way, we looked up articles/blogs that do so. The next stage that develops the best possible
        understanding of the users is to define their problems. This stage was really useful to us for this
        became the root of our project. It is where our hard work revolves, for this is when we analyzed
        our synthesis in order to define the main problem that we have identified, which is in our case,
        the problems of students managing their activities. The ideation process, the third stage of the
        Design Thinking Process, is the most collaborative part of our group discussion. This is where
        our Personas and Storyboards kicked in. We generated ideas to form these things, and from it 
        we are able to identify a tech-solution to the problem statement that we have created. The
        tech-solution of our project would be an app that keeps track of students assignments and
        activities, notifies them about it, and offers a systematic planning of what activity to do first.
        The fourth stage of the process would be the Prototype. Well, in the development of our
        project and the course, this is where we are all at. We created a prototype to provide an early
        visualization of how our application would look after completion. The next stage of the process
        that we have to do is to Test the prototype and see if we meet our expectations. This last stage
        also helps gather feedback to further improve our process. But we just have to wait for now
        before proceeding to the last stage. We first need to finish this reflection for our midterms.
        <br><br><br>

        I never knew that the Design Thinking Process approach would be this useful to us
        students. And it will be most useful when we are pursuing our future endeavors in the industry.
        I will apply this approach to the next projects that I would handle, especially when it concerns
        user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) designs. I wanted to produce a project/output that
        exceeds my and our potential users expectations. Therefore, I will maximize the use of the
        Design Thinking Process to every project.
