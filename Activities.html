      <h2>My Favorite Application</h2>
      <h3>My favorite application at the moment is the famous, Facebook application. What I like about
        this application is that you could share, read, watch, stalk, view, and post almost everything. What makes
        it good for me is that the application is the source of my happiness when I see funny posts such as
        memes and watch videos that entertains me. I follow pages that I liked and whenever I’m not doing
        anything, I’m on Facebook; and I just scroll and scroll to my heart’s content. I think I’ve been using
        Facebook for over 8 years now. I remember creating an account when I was in my 6th grade and I just
        post and share anything that I want. I was able to talk to my friends and classmates through this app
        back then, since Messenger is not yet created and developed at that time. The features on Facebook
        really developed for the better over the years. I was able to play online games through the app; watch
        videos, posts pictures, videos, and texts; I could save posts for later use; I use its albums as a backup or
        dump for the photos and videos stored in my phone to free up some space; and you can create and
        support pages that create almost any content such as a school’s dashboard, newscasts, foundations,
        gaming content, and charities. Mainly, what I like about this Facebook application is that I could catch
        up with my friends, family, relatives, and colleagues lives and stories with what they post and share. It’s
        a way for us to really connect with each other still keeping in check what’s happening with our lives. We
        get to share the same experience and able to contribute meaningful to someone else’s lives. This
        application really bridges lives and relationships regardless of distance and time.
